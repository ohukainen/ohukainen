## Projects

### [Chip-8 Emulator/Virtual Machine](https://github.com/ohukainen/chip8)

- Description: A Chip-8 Emulator/Virtual Machine that can read and execute operation codes.
- Key Takeaways: Learned how a CPU reads and processes binary data to execute commands, an important concept to understand as a C/C++ developer.

### [Real Time Object Detection](https://github.com/ohukainen/real_time_object_detection)

- Description: A Real Time Object Detector that uses DI to enable easy exansions.
- Key Takeaways: Learned about the details regarding applying a YOLO model, future endeavors include expading to YOLOv11.

### [Neovim setup](https://github.com/ohukainen/kickstart.nvim)

- Description: This is my nvim config based on [ThePrimeagens config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) and [kickstart.neovim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
- Key Takeaways: I like a minimalist setup and therefore removed some of the more flashy parts of kickstart. I also added some of my own favorite packages like harpoon and fugitive. 

### [My website](https://www.johanneskallstad.com/)

- Description: My very own website under development currently.
- Key Takeaways: Currently in development so I have none yet!

## Other Technologies 
I have some experience with these languages but mostly basic usage.
