## Projects

### [Chip-8 Emulator/Virtual Machine](https://github.com/ohukainen/chip8)

- Description: A Chip-8 Emulator/Virtual Machine that can read and execute operation codes.
- Key Takeaways: Learned how a CPU reads and processes binary data to execute commands, an important concept to understand as a C/C++ developer.

### [Neovim setup](https://github.com/ohukainen/kickstart.nvim)

- Description: My nvim setup based on kickstart neovim (will be rewritten in a separate repo).
- Key Takeaways: I like a minimalist setup and therefore removed some of the more flashy parts of kickstart. I also added some of my own favorite packages like harpoon and fugitive. 

### [My website](https://www.johanneskallstad.com/)

- Description: My very own website under development currently.
- Key Takeaways: Currently in development so I have none yet!
